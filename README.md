This project has been created for Lewus's programming competition. While I was building it, I discovered that form of authentication to 3rd party APIs is **super dangerous** and because of that, project is discontinued. Project will probably make some sense when 7tv will launch v3 api (as far as I know it may have some better auth method for 3rd party devs), but till it's not online please don't ressurect it.

# EmoteVoter
Discord voter for twitch and youtube emotes.

This app is for streamers that are sick of requests to add / remove  / change emote. Let the community do the thing automatically.

## Emote services support
 - ❌ (in development for now) 7tv
 - ❌ BetterTTV
 - ❌ FrankerFaceZ

## WARNING
This app is probably super dangerous to use because of form of authentication that emote voter uses.

I can't change that form of authentication because of lack of 3rd party API for those services.
